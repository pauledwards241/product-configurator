# Product Configurator

A hardcover notebook product configurator. The UI should look and work as expected based on the requirements and design brief.

## How to run

1. `git clone https://github.com/pauledwards241/product-configurator.git`
2. `cd product-configurator`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm start`
5. In a browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Limitations due to time constraints

- It's currently fairly specific to one product, but could be extended to handle multiple products with a bit more time
- There are no unit or integration tests :disappointed:
- Comments in the code should explain some other shortcuts I've taken
